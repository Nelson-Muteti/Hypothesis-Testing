## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<img src="http://www.travel-images.com/pht/france957.jpg">



* Bluecars are an electric ride sharing company based in France. 

* This project was commisioned with the intent of analysing bluecar ride sharing data from

Paris, France.

* The goal is to test a hypothesis made about the average number of Bluecars taken on Sunday being higher 

 than those taken on Monday.

* I am supposed to test this claim (hypothesis) and come up with a decision

 on acceptance or rejection criteria.

* At the same time,I am supposed to do Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate)

 inorder to understand the data.

## Data Used

* The data used over the course of this project is provided by Bluecar and can be accessed

 from my project documentation.

* There are 2 datasets, 1 of which is a Car dataset with 13 columns

 while the other file is a glossary detailing the context of the columns. 

## Technologies Used

* I Used Google Colab as my work environment.
 
* I found Google colab  to be a great  tool to implement the Data Science project since it was
   
  easier to link with resources and platforms such as GITHUB.

## Support

*Contact Nelson Muteti : nelsonmuteti012@gmail.com for any clarification.

*No need to request permission to fork this project.

*Suggestions on improvement are welcome.
